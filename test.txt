How are you?
10 kills or how are you?
I'm alright, I'm gonna do better.
Hi.
You can be able to hold the book in tomorrow.
Uh huh.
Five till then.
Okay, so you want me to close the booking tomorrow from 5 p.m.
Right?
Yeah, you can keep it just from 12 till 5.
Five included.
Okay, so the booking should be available.
I don't want any book.
Uh huh.
Yes.
I don't want any book in half five till whatever.
I understand.
So the booking from 12 to 5 is okay, but later than 5 is not.
Yes.
No.
Okay.
I'll do that.
No worries.
Anything else?
Thank you so much.
