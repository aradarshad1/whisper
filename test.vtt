Hi.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
You can be able to hold the book in tomorrow.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
Uh huh.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
Five till then.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
Okay, so you want me to close the booking tomorrow from 5 p.m.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Yeah, you can keep it just from 12 till 5.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
Okay, so the booking should be available.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000

So the booking from 12 to 5 is okay, but later than 5 is not.

Okay.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
I'll do that.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
No worries.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
