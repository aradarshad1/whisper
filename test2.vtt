00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Can we take your ordering system provider?

00:03.000 --> 00:11.000
Yeah, did you get my message that people are saying they're trying to order online and they can't do it through the web?

00:11.000 --> 00:20.000
Okay, so there is only one reason if they can't order and that's because they are out of the delivering area.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
We can add more push goods if we can deliver to them.

00:24.000 --> 00:31.000
No, no, no, no, there's well in, it was well within, it was only two minutes away from the place.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
Okay, so it wasn't far out, it was just two minutes away.

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
The first order of the night didn't come through properly either.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
I mean, there was trouble in the last night.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.000
There's been sort of ongoing problems that never seems to go smoothly with this machine.

00:51.000 --> 00:58.000
So, is that the printer issue?

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
No, it's not been a transition.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
It was a transition issue earlier on tonight.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
But then somebody phoned the actual work phone to make an order.

01:07.000 --> 01:14.000
And they said that they couldn't, the app kept cutting them out.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
What did cut them out?

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
Yeah, well, they couldn't complete the order on the app.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Okay, on the app or website.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
Okay, let me just log into your website and app and see if I can place a test order.

01:27.000 --> 01:33.000
Just a second, I'll send both a collection order and the delivery one has a test.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
Please check it out from your site and see if you received them at the shop.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Right, okay.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
You're getting printed.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Yeah, do that, that's great.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
I will do that, okay?

01:44.000 --> 01:50.000
So, let me just stay on the line or you can give me time so I can place the orders and get back to you.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Yeah, okay then, thanks.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Okay, I'll do that.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Thank you, bye-bye.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Yeah, bye-bye.
