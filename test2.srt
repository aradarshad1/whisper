1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Can we take your ordering system provider?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yeah, did you get my message that people are saying they're trying to order online and they can't do it through the web?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Okay, so there is only one reason if they can't order and that's because they are out of the delivering area.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We can add more push goods if we can deliver to them.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
No, no, no, no, there's well in, it was well within, it was only two minutes away from the place.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Okay, so it wasn't far out, it was just two minutes away.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The first order of the night didn't come through properly either.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I mean, there was trouble in the last night.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
There's been sort of ongoing problems that never seems to go smoothly with this machine.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So, is that the printer issue?

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
No, it's not been a transition.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It was a transition issue earlier on tonight.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
But then somebody phoned the actual work phone to make an order.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And they said that they couldn't, the app kept cutting them out.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
What did cut them out?

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yeah, well, they couldn't complete the order on the app.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Okay, on the app or website.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Okay, let me just log into your website and app and see if I can place a test order.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Just a second, I'll send both a collection order and the delivery one has a test.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Please check it out from your site and see if you received them at the shop.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Right, okay.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You're getting printed.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yeah, do that, that's great.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I will do that, okay?

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So, let me just stay on the line or you can give me time so I can place the orders and get back to you.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yeah, okay then, thanks.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Okay, I'll do that.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Thank you, bye-bye.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yeah, bye-bye.
