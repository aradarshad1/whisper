0	3000	Can we take your ordering system provider?
3000	11000	Yeah, did you get my message that people are saying they're trying to order online and they can't do it through the web?
11000	20000	Okay, so there is only one reason if they can't order and that's because they are out of the delivering area.
20000	24000	We can add more push goods if we can deliver to them.
24000	31000	No, no, no, no, there's well in, it was well within, it was only two minutes away from the place.
31000	37000	Okay, so it wasn't far out, it was just two minutes away.
37000	42000	The first order of the night didn't come through properly either.
42000	45000	I mean, there was trouble in the last night.
45000	51000	There's been sort of ongoing problems that never seems to go smoothly with this machine.
51000	58000	So, is that the printer issue?
58000	60000	No, it's not been a transition.
60000	63000	It was a transition issue earlier on tonight.
63000	67000	But then somebody phoned the actual work phone to make an order.
67000	74000	And they said that they couldn't, the app kept cutting them out.
74000	77000	What did cut them out?
77000	80000	Yeah, well, they couldn't complete the order on the app.
80000	82000	Okay, on the app or website.
82000	87000	Okay, let me just log into your website and app and see if I can place a test order.
87000	93000	Just a second, I'll send both a collection order and the delivery one has a test.
93000	97000	Please check it out from your site and see if you received them at the shop.
97000	98000	Right, okay.
98000	99000	You're getting printed.
99000	100000	Yeah, do that, that's great.
100000	103000	I will do that, okay?
104000	110000	So, let me just stay on the line or you can give me time so I can place the orders and get back to you.
110000	112000	Yeah, okay then, thanks.
112000	113000	Okay, I'll do that.
113000	114000	Thank you, bye-bye.
114000	116000	Yeah, bye-bye.
